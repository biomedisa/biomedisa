              <p> The segmentation is based on a smart interpolation of sparsely pre-segmented slices taking into account the complete underlying image data. That means, before you perform the segmentation process, you must pre-segment some reference slices in a segmentation editor of your choice. The pre-segmented slices are used to automatically segment the remaining volume. To start the segmentation process, upload your image data and your pre-segmented slices and click the start button.</p>

              <p><b>1. Not all labels are assigned in each pre-segmented slice:</b> the non-labeled area in pre-segmented slices corresponds to the background label, therefore all structures must be labeled simultaneously in the pre-segmented slices. Otherwise, this area is assigned to the background.</p>
              <p><b>2. Not using “All axes” if pre-segmenting slices with different orientations:</b> If the pre-segmentation is not exclusively in the xy plane, then the “All axes” function must be enabled in the settings. In this case, there must also be at least one empty slice between pre-segmented slices. </p>
          </div>

          <button id="qs3" class="accordion" onclick="toggleAccordion(this.id);"> <b> 3) How does the semi-automated segmentation algorithm work?</b> </button>
          <div id="ans3" class="panel">
              <p> To segment the image data, several weighted random walks start in the pre-segmented slices and diffuse into the volume. Over time, the voxels are hit by these random walks. Based on the number of hits, the probability that a voxel belongs to a segment is calculated. The segmentation can then be performed by assigning each voxel to the label from which the most hits come. You can think of Biomedisa as an interpolation that takes the underlying image data into account.</p>

          <button id="qs4" class="accordion" onclick="toggleAccordion(this.id);"> <b> 4) How to use Biomedisa AI?</b> </button>
          <div id="ans4" class="panel">
<p><b>Training:</b> To train a deep neural network, simply select multiple image files along with their corresponding fully segmented label files, ensuring each pair resides within a distinct project. Alternatively, streamline the process by uploading both image and label files in TAR format (<b>.tar</b> or <b>.tar.gz</b>), respectively. Ensure the image file names match their corresponding label file names, such as "brain_1.tif" and "brain_1.labels.tif," as exemplified in our <a href="https://biomedisa.info/gallery/" title="gallery">gallery</a>. Once organized, initiate the training process by clicking the AI button <img src="/static/ai_logo.svg" title="train" style="width:18px;height:18px;border:0;">.</p>
<p><b>Validation:</b> Optionally enable validation splitting in the settings. A validation split of 0.8 allocates 80% for training and 20% for network validation after each epoch, saving only the best-performing network state. For more convenience, upload validation images and labels separately in TAR files, mirroring the training data structure, and enable "Validation Data" in the settings.</p>
<p><b>Data augmentation:</b> During training, you have the option to augment your dataset to prevent overfitting by enabling random flips along the XYZ axes or data rotation in the settings. Ensure that these augmentations maintain a natural representation; for instance, refrain from mirroring across the X-axis if asymmetry between left and right sides exists.</p>
<p><b>Prediction:</b> Upon completion of training, select the trained network and specify one or more images for prediction. For more convenience when segmenting multiple images, they can also be uploaded in a TAR file. Execute the prediction by pressing the predict button <img src="/static/predict.svg" title="predict" style="width:18px;height:18px;border:0;">.</p>

          <button id="qs5" class="accordion" onclick="toggleAccordion(this.id);"> <b> 5) What are the two most common user errors using Biomedisa AI?</b> </button>
          <div id="ans5" class="panel">
              <p><b>1. GPU out of memory due to too many labels:</b> Depending on the available GPU memory, the number of labels should not be more than ten.</p>
              <p><b>2. Only labeling slices of the volume for training:</b> Biomedisa AI uses the entire 3D image and annotations for training. If you have only pre-segmented individual slices, please use Biomedisa Interpolation first to get a full segmentation.</p>

          <button id="qs6" class="accordion" onclick="toggleAccordion(this.id);"> <b> 6) Which hardware requirements do I need for Biomedisa Interpolation?</b> </button>
          <div id="ans6" class="panel">
                <p>
                    <p><b>Online:</b> No special hardware required. <br><br> <b>Locally:</b> You must have at least one state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPU. The most important points are the GPU memory and the memory of your system (RAM). How much memory you exactly need depends on the size of the image you want to segment. To give you an idea, we tested two of our showcases, which you can download from our <b><a href="https://biomedisa.info/gallery/" title="gallery">gallery</a></b>. First, we used a workstation with a GeForce 1080 Ti (11 GB GPU memory). The system has 60 GB of RAM. Second, we used a server with 4 NVIDIA Tesla V100 (each of it has 32 GB of GPU memory) and 750 GB of RAM.</p>

                    <p>1. The <b>biological screw</b> is a rather small image (419 x 492 x 462 voxels). About 7 GB of RAM and 3 GB of GPU memory were used. Two objects were pre-segmented every 20th slice.</p>

                    <p style="text-indent:10px;">1 NVIDIA GeForce 1080 Ti (11 GB) &#8680; 6 min 36 sec</p>
                    <p style="text-indent:10px;">4 NVIDIA Tesla V100 (each 32 GB) &#8680; 1 min 2 sec</p>

                    <p>2. <b>Female parasitoid</b> (1077 x 992 x 2553 voxels). Images of this size are widely used on Biomedisa. About 40 GB of RAM and 10 GB of GPU memory were used. Originally, we pre-segmented 56 individual body parts every 10th slice. But for this test, we only used pre-segmentations of every 20th slice to speed up the computation.</p>

                    <p style="text-indent:10px;">1 GeForce 1080 Ti (11 GB) &#8680; 1 h 25 min 34 sec</p>

          <button id="qs7" class="accordion" onclick="toggleAccordion(this.id);"> <b> 7) What image file format can be processed?</b> </button>
          <div id="ans7" class="panel">
              <p> The following three-dimensional data file formats are supported:
<b>Multipage TIFF, Amira mesh (AM), MHD, MHA, NRRD and NIfTI (.nii & .nii.gz)</b>. In addition, a zipped folder containing two-dimensional slices as <b>DICOM, PNG</b>, or <b>TIFF</b> that represent the volume can also be uploaded. The data type can be <b>8-bit</b>, <b>16-bit</b> or <b>32-bit</b> integer or float. You can even upload <b>64-bit</b> images but they are automatically converted to 32-bit during the calculation. </p>
          </div>

          <button id="qs8" class="accordion" onclick="toggleAccordion(this.id);"> <b> 8) What should my label file look like?</b> </button>
          <div id="ans8" class="panel">
              <p> The label file should contain pre-segmented reference slices. It must have exactly the same <i>xyz</i>-dimensions like the uploaded image file. If you use an Amira label file, all your information, like names and colors, will be preserved. Once you label a slice, all segments that appear in this slice must be labeled. Otherwise, these areas are considered as background, and your segmentation will not be correct. Tip: Download one of our showcases from our <b><a href="https://biomedisa.info/gallery/" title="gallery">gallery</a></b> and see how the label files were created. </p>
          </div>

          <button id="qs9" class="accordion" onclick="toggleAccordion(this.id);"> <b> 9) Is it possible to label in a different plane than the xy-plane?</b> </button>
          <div id="ans9" class="panel">
              <p> You can activate All axes in the settings <img src="/static/einst_filled.jpg" title="settings" style="width:18px;height:18px;border:0;"> next to your label file. You can then label in either all three orientations at the same time or in one or two orientations of your choice. There must be at least one empty slice between your pre-segmented slices. The algorithm needs this to detect in which orientations you have pre-segmented. </p>
          </div>

          <button id="qs10" class="accordion" onclick="toggleAccordion(this.id);"> <b> 10) How big can my data be?</b> </button>
          <div id="ans10" class="panel">
              <p> The region of interest can be roughly 8 GB large (e.g. 2000 x 2000 x 2000 for 8-bit images). Biomedisa checks whether your data can be processed or not. If your data is too large, it will automatically complain and stop the process. So just give it a try. </p>

          <div id="ans11" class="panel">
              <p> In addition to the <b>regular</b> result without any post-processing, you can choose between <b>cleaned</b> (removed outliers), <b>filled holes</b>, post-processed with <b>active contours</b>, <b>uncertainty</b> (a probability map on how uncertain your segmentation result is), and a <b>smoothed</b> version. You can fine-tune these features in the settings <img src="/static/einst_filled.jpg" title="settings" style="width:18px;height:18px;border:0;">. </p>
