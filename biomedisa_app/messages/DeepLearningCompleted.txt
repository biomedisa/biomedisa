Dear {{username}},

Biomedisa successfully {{info}} {{image_name}} in {{ctime}} on {{server_name}}.

Please note the two most common user errors using Biomedisa AI:

1. GPU out of memory due to too many labels:

Depending on the available GPU memory, the number of labels should not be more than ten.

2. Only labeling slices of the volume for training:

Biomedisa AI uses the entire 3D image and annotations for training. If you have only pre-segmented individual slices, please use Biomedisa Interpolation first to get a full segmentation.
